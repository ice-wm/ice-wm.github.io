IceWM is a window manager for the X Window System.
The goal of IceWM is speed, simplicity,
and not getting in the user's way.
It comes with a taskbar with pager,
global and per-window keybindings
and a dynamic menu system.
Application windows can be managed by keyboard and mouse.
Windows can be iconified to the taskbar,
to the tray, to the desktop or be made hidden.
They are controllable by a quick switch
window (Alt+Tab) and in a window list.
A handful of configurable focus models are menu-selectable.
Setups with multiple monitors are supported by RandR and Xinerama.
IceWM is very configurable, themable and well documented.
It includes an optional external background
wallpaper manager with transparency support,
a simple session manager and a system tray.
IceWM is available on popular Linux distributions like
Debian, Ubuntu, Arch, OpenSUSE, Gentoo, Slackware, CentOS
and also compiles on most \*BSDs.
