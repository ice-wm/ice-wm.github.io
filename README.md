### Themable

IceWM is themeable. Every setting from the preferences file can be changed
by a theme. This includes titlebars, borders, icons, events, the taskbar,
etc. IceWM supports pixmapped and non-pixmapped themes and comes with an
example theme for all the theme types (warp3, warp4, win95, motif, nice,
pixmap, metal, gtk) that IceWM supports.
Currently more than 400 themes can be downloaded from
[box-look.org](https://www.box-look.org/browse/cat/142/ord/latest/).
